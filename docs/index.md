# HRCG teardown

This is my attempt to disassemble some of the routines on the DOS Toolkit disk, also known as the Applesoft Tool Kit. Don Lancaster's *Tearing Into Machine Language Code* suggests disassembling the Apple Hi-Res Character Generator (HRGC), and I started with its building blocks, the relocatable module loaders.

So far I've disassembled:

- [RBOOT](RBOOT.html) -- loads and relocates RLOAD.
- [RLOAD](RLOAD.html) -- loads and relocates HRCG, APA or other relocatable module.

And made a start on:

- [HRCG](HRCG.code.html) -- Hi-Res Character Generator. The disassembly is of the HRCG code itself. The header (code length) and footer (relocatable table entries) are normally generated by EDASM.

Afterward I found Dr John B Matthews had already done an [analysis of RBOOT/RLOAD for ProDOS](https://sites.google.com/site/drjohnbmatthews/apple2/rel). Mine was just for fun anyway, but since the DOS 3.3 version has a lot of differences, it might be useful.

RBOOT/RLOAD for DOS are described in `applesoft_toolkit__part_2_.pdf` (chapter 4) on Asimov.
HRCG is mostly described in part 1 (chapter 2).
